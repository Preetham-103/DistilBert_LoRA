**🎯 DistilBERT Fine-Tuning with LoRA for Sentiment Analysis 🎬📊**
**🚀 Overview**
This project demonstrates fine-tuning a pre-trained DistilBERT model using LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) for Sentiment Analysis on the IMDB movie reviews dataset. 📖🎥

DistilBERT, known for its lightweight architecture, combined with LoRA, allows for efficient fine-tuning by reducing the number of trainable parameters. This is perfect for achieving top performance on NLP tasks with fewer computational resources. 💡🔧

**✨ Features**
Pre-trained Model: Utilizes Hugging Face's DistilBERT for a smaller yet powerful transformer model. 🤖
LoRA Technique: Fine-tunes the model by adapting low-rank matrices, leading to faster training with fewer resources. 🧠💼
IMDB Dataset: Classifies movie reviews into positive or negative sentiments. 🎬👍👎
Efficient Training: Leverages LoRA to reduce GPU memory usage and training time. ⏳💻

**🛠️ Technologies Used**
DistilBERT: Lightweight transformer model by Hugging Face.
LoRA: A parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique.
IMDB Dataset: Movie review dataset for sentiment classification.
PyTorch: Deep learning framework for model training.
Hugging Face Transformers: For handling pre-trained language models.

**📊 Model Training**
We fine-tuned the DistilBERT model with LoRA on the IMDB dataset to classify reviews as either positive 😊 or negative 😔. This approach ensures that we can train powerful models even in resource-constrained environments. 💪✨

**🔧 Installation**
To get started with this project, you'll need to set up the environment and install the dependencies:


**🚀 How to Run**
Download the IMDB dataset or use an alternative dataset for sentiment analysis.
Run the notebook: Execute the DistBert_QLoRA.ipynb notebook to fine-tune the model.
Evaluate the Model: Once training is complete, evaluate the sentiment classification performance.

**💡 Future Enhancements**
Expand the model for multi-class sentiment analysis (e.g., neutral, very positive, very negative). 🎯
Implement model deployment using Flask or FastAPI. 🌐
Explore fine-tuning on other NLP tasks like text summarization or question answering. 📚❓
